File composed of 2 sections: 
	-> Header
	-> Level configuration

The Header (4 first characters):
	char 1 : number of columns - 1 (between 1 and 16)
	char 2 : monster speed
	char 3 : level border (in pixels)
	char 4 : concatenation of 3 parameters :
			-> Number of characters in which life will be coded (0 => 2 characters ; 1 => 4 characters)
			-> Number of characters in which image index will be coded (0 => 1 characters ; 1 => 2 characters)
			-> Number of characters in which experience will be coded (0 => 2 characters ; 1 => 4 characters)
		The result of those 3 is put in binary form (e.g. : 010 => 2 which corresponds to 
																			2 characters for the life
																			2 characters for the image
																			2 characters for the experience
		If the result of character 4 is bigger than 7, then it's incorrect (only 3 bits known)

The Level Configuration:
	Indicates the configuration of each alien from the left to the right, low to up
	Each alien is coded in 3 parts, corresponding to the lengths found in character 4
		-> Alien's Life
		-> Alien's skin (image)
		-> Alien's experience given when shot
	The sequence F3 indicates an empty spot (a place where there is no aliens)
	The configuration is stopped at sequence F1

The file ends with the sequence F2
